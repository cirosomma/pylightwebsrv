Pylightwebsrv
===============

A simple web server written in python with socket module.

Features :
[+] A config file for loading quickly information of startup
[+] A log file with all request GET or POST
[+] Only static page can be opened

I hope that I will be successful to add a new function about for to use dynamic pages in a short time
